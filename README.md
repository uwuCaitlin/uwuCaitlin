## FAQ 

* What editing programme do we use?

> Our entire team works with Adobe Premier Pro.

* How many are there in our team?

> There are two of me, Caitlin and uwuCex! We have known each other for over 2 years now and have split our projects in between us so we can deliver on time and when you need it the most.

* What are your prices?

> It really depends on how long the video is, how many minutes it is, and how long you will need it for! But the basic prices are as follows: Up to 5 minutes of footage is around 15 USD. Max Length Video of up to 15 minutes is 36 USD. If you need something longer than this, we can discuss it!

* Where do i order from you?

* Where does all the money go?

> All the money goes back into the editing business. We want all of this to improve. The majority of the money currently goes into paying for subscriptions like Adobe, as well as improving our equipment!

### Why us over others?

> We have more experience than others! We may be new to the scene of video editing and yes, it may be over saturated with other people's videos, but we have the way and we have the will! We, as a team, have worked under complete time requirements, with us being able to get a video and have it come out looking completely professional!

> We have the skills. As I mentioned above, we first started video editing in 2020 as a hobby, but we have developed it from just a hobby into becoming something more of a job. We, like you, want to use our skills and our work to one day make enough money from it to live off of it!

> We have the education; as it was just a hobby, we decided we wanted to learn more. Both me and uwuCex have both gone to college for editing as well as photography, both learning about the different shots as well as how we can use those shots to our advantage to tell a story 

> We are willing to learn and take the time—not happy with how we did something—want us to change it as well as we can! 

## How do I make a payment?!

We accept PayPal payments from friends and family!This helps us! 

## Learn about the editors'

The editors themselves are often found playing games such as Minecraft and Valorant, as well as working on their projects. This is because we enjoy editing as much for ourselves as we do for others. A bit like how chefs cook for others and themselves, we do it with editing too.

> Caitlin's about me in under 50 words. Caitlin has many hobbies, such as swimming and going on dates, often making her boyfriend spend money on her by buying her plushies, sweets, and cuddling. On her off days, she likes to sit down and have a movie night. Some of her favourite shows are Doctor Who, Pokemon, and Tokyo Goul.

> uwuCex spends most of his days sleeping when he isn't editing. He often goes out with his family and goes on long walks. He enjoys editing because it allows him to be absorbed into his own world and he doesn't have to worry about what is going on around him.

> Caitlin and uwuCex have known each other and been friends with each other since they were both 14. We are now 18 and going on to our second year of college and we want to continue learning about both editing and photography to one day do it as a job.
